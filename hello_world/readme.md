# Hello World
### Write a program that greets the user by name, or by saying "Hello, World!" if no name is given.

"Hello, World!" is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language.

If I tell the program my name is Alice, it will greet me by saying "Hello, Alice!".

If I neglect to give it my name, it will greet me by saying "Hello, World!"
